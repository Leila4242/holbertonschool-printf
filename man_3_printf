.TH _PRINTF 3 "January 2026" "1.0" "_printf Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR _printf ()
function produces output according to a
.I format
as described below. This function writes output to
.IR stdout ,
the standard output stream.
.PP
The
.BR _printf ()
function writes the output under the control of a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via
the variable-length argument facilities of
.BR stdarg (3))
are converted for output.
.SS Return value
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters
printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SS Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its
initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or
more directives: ordinary characters (not
.BR % ),
which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more
subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by
the character
.BR % ,
and ends with a
.IR "conversion specifier" .
.SS Conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The
conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.B d, i
The
.I int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision, if any,
gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted
value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.
.TP
.B c
The
.I int
argument is converted to an
.IR "unsigned char" ,
and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
The
.I "const char *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type
(pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but
not including) a terminating null byte ('\\0'). If the argument is NULL,
the string "(null)" is printed instead.
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
specification is '%%'.
.SH EXAMPLES
To print the day of the year, where
.I weekday
and
.I month
are pointers to strings and
.I day
and
.I year
are integers:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
_printf("%s, %s %d, %d\\n", weekday, month, day, year);
.EE
.in
.PP
To print pi to 2 decimal places (note: this implementation does not
support floating-point):
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
_printf("pi = %d.%d\\n", 3, 14);
.EE
.in
.PP
To print a character and a string:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
char letter = 'A';
char *message = "Hello, World!";
_printf("Character: %c, Message: %s\\n", letter, message);
.EE
.in
.SH NOTES
The
.BR _printf ()
function is a simplified implementation and does not handle all features
of the standard
.BR printf (3)
function. Notably, it does not support:
.IP \(bu 2
Field width
.IP \(bu
Precision for strings and integers
.IP \(bu
Length modifiers (h, l, ll, etc.)
.IP \(bu
Flag characters (+, -, 0, #, space)
.IP \(bu
Floating-point conversion specifiers (f, e, g, etc.)
.IP \(bu
Other conversion specifiers (o, u, x, X, p, n, etc.)
.SH BUGS
This implementation does not fully replicate all edge cases and features
of the standard
.BR printf (3)
function.
